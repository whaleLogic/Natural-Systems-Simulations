**Summary**
--------

This repository is designed to store all my natural systems simulations and GML models in which I will expore the following: 

* **Natural Systems**: Simulate complex systems, such as weather patterns, bacteria growth, ecosystem interactions and population dynamics.
* **Developing GML Models**: Create and share graphical models that illustrate the underlying
structures and behaviors of natural things like particle systems, waves, oscillations, even bacteria growth. ü©π
* Anything can be modeled!  ü§ñ ü™ê


**Getting Started**
-----------------

1. **Fork this repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. **Install dependencies**: Run `npm install` or `pip install` depending on your package
manager.
3. **Explore simulations and models**: Browse through the simulation files (e.g.,
`weather_forecast.js`) and model files (e.g., `ecosystem_model.gml`).
### OR 
1. Navigate to the subdirectory you want and run <code>python3 -m http.server</code>
2. Open the index.html file in that subdirectory
