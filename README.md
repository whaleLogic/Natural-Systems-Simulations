**Natural Systems Simulations and GML Models**
==============================================

![GitHub Logo](https://github.com/symbols/blob/master/logos/github-icon.png)

**Welcome to [Repository Name], a collection of simulations and GML (Graphical Modeling
Language) models that explore the complexities of natural systems.**

**About**
--------

This repository is designed to store all my natural systems simulations and GML models,
providing a centralized platform for:

* **Exploring Natural Systems**: Simulate complex systems, such as weather patterns, population
dynamics, and ecosystem interactions.
* **Developing GML Models**: Create and share graphical models that illustrate the underlying
structures and behaviors of natural systems.

**Features**
------------

* **Natural System Simulations**: A collection of simulations that model real-world natural
systems, including:
        + Weather forecasting
        + Ecosystem modeling
        + Population dynamics
        + Water cycle simulation
* **GML Models**: A library of graphical models that represent the underlying structures and
behaviors of natural systems, including:
        + Phase space diagrams
        + Network topologies
        + Fractal patterns

**Getting Started**
-----------------

1. **Fork this repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. **Install dependencies**: Run `npm install` or `pip install` depending on your package
manager.
3. **Explore simulations and models**: Browse through the simulation files (e.g.,
`weather_forecast.js`) and model files (e.g., `ecosystem_model.gml`).

**Contribute**
-------------

* **Submit new simulations or models**: Create a new branch, add your changes, and submit a pull
request.
* **Participate in discussions**: Join the discussion forum to share ideas, ask questions, and
get feedback on your work.
