**Welcome to my repo! This is an ongoing collection of simulations and GML (Graphical Modeling
Language) models that explore the complexities of natural systems using common physics and mathematical formulas such as <em>Newtons Law of Universal Gravitation.</em>**

- Please enjoy my whale picture.  

**What is this??**
--------

This repository is designed to store all my natural systems simulations and GML models in which I will expore the following: 

* **Natural Systems**: Simulate complex systems, such as weather patterns, bacteria growth, ecosystem interactions and population dynamics.
* **Developing GML Models**: Create and share graphical models that illustrate the underlying
structures and behaviors of natural things like particle systems, waves, oscillations, even bacteria growth. ðŸ©¹

## Anything can be modeled!!


**Getting Started**
-----------------

1. **Fork this repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. **Install dependencies**: Run `npm install` or `pip install` depending on your package
manager.
3. **Explore simulations and models**: Browse through the simulation files (e.g.,
`weather_forecast.js`) and model files (e.g., `ecosystem_model.gml`).
### OR 
1. Navigate to the subdirectory you want and run <code>python3 -m http.server</code>
2. Open the index.html file in that subdirectory, e.g. 'n-body-problem' -> index.html (browser)

**Contribute**
-------------

* **Submit new simulations or models**: Create a new branch, add your changes, and submit a pull
request.
* **Participate in discussions**: Join the discussion forum to share ideas, ask questions, and
get feedback on your work.
